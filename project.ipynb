    "In univariate analyses there is a distinction between whole-brain and [ROI-based](https://doi.org/10.1093/scan/nsm006) analyses. When done correctly, whole-brain univariate analyses allow you to identify, in an unbiased and data-driven way, regions of the brain that differ between experimental conditions. Compare this to what we have done with multivariate classification: up to this point we have taken ROIs (e.g., FFA, PPA, even the whole brain) and looked at the pattern of activity across voxels. Using these procedures we have been able to determine whether these voxels collectively contain information about different conditions. However, it has been unclear whether a subset of these voxels have been driving classification accuracy, partly because it is tricky to interpret the resulting weights. In other words, we have been unable to say with certainty *where* in the brain there are representations that distinguish between conditions. For more information on the searchlight technique, reade [this comprehensive NeuroImage Comment by Etzel et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.03.041), that also includes citations to landmark papers on the topic.\n",

    "A searchlight is a spherical or cubic moving window that allows us to identify and localize such representations. Running a searchlight is computationally intensive because it involves running a separate multivariate analysis for every voxel in the brain. Imagine doing your feature selection, hyper-parameter optimization, and cross-validation 100,000 times or more. Fortunately, [BrainIAK](http://brainiak.org/) contains a procedure that efficiently carves up brain data into appropriate chunks and distributes them across the computational resources available.\n",

    "## 2. Searchlight Workflow <a id=\"sl_wf\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Running a searchlight is computationally intensive, complex and involves many steps. To show how the searchlight functionality in BrainIAK works, we will walk through the steps needed to perform a simple searchlight that can be run in this notebook before moving onto a real example. This simple workflow takes the following steps:\n",

    ">5. [Execute the searchlight](#exec_sl)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, before we start, there are a few things that you should now about searchlights. Think of a searchlight as a processing step in which you pull out a certain size chunk of your data and then perform a kernel operation (specified by a function you write). You can use any kernel on this chunk of data interchangeably. Critically, **the searchlight function does not specify the analysis you want to perform, all it does is carve up the data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computational demand and parallelization**\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, searchlights are computationally intensive and so we need to be aware of what kind of burden they might impose. In the participant you loaded, we want to perform the operation about 177,000 times (once for each of their brain voxels). If we were to run this serially, even if each operation only took 1 s to complete, the analysis would take 50 hours(!), and only for this one participant. With nested cross-validation or other recursive steps, the full analysis could take months or years (and you'd lose a lot of points on your assignment).\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, the searchlight function in [BrainIAK](http://brainiak.org/) intelligently parallelizes your data to give you a considerable and scalable speed boost. Parallelization is the idea that when two or more computational tasks can be completed independently (because they don't interact in any way) then it is possible to run these tasks simultaneously on different cores. Note that we refer to cores as our unit of serial processing, although there are other parallelizations available within-core, such as threads or even multiple instructions within thread. The nice thing about parallelization is that it is scalable: in general, a job parallelized across 10 cores will run 10 times faster than on one core. For reference, your computer likely has 2, 4, or more cores, so you could speed up processing if you recruited all of these resources (and shut down all other types of background processing). Milgram, the cluster you are running on, has about 1,500 cores, meaning in theory if you could run a job simultaneously across all of these cores then the searchlight we talked about before would be taken down from 50 hours to 2 mins. In practice, there is often some start up cost when calling a function, such as loading the data, which could reduce this benefit a little (maybe to 5 mins).\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "So remember, the two main things that determine the speed of a searchlight: the **kernel algorithm** and the **amount of parallelization**.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does the BrainIAK searchlight work?**\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze data efficiently, it is important to understand how the Searchlight function in [BrainIAK](http://brainiak.org/) works. The searchlight code simply searches for every voxel in the mask that is equal to 1 and then centers a searchlight around this. This means that for every value of 1 in your mask, the searchlight function will apply your kernel function. Hence when writing the kernel you need to keep in mind that the input data that the function receives is not the size of the original data but is instead the size of the searchlight radius. In other words, you might give the searchlight function a brain and mask volume that is 64x64x64 but each kernel operation only runs on a data and mask volume that is 3x3x3 (or whatever your searchlight radius is). As per the logic of searchlights, the center of each mask in the searchlight will be equal to 1 (otherwise the searchlight wouldn't have selected it). \n",
    "\n",
    "**How to start using a searchlight? Small!**\n",
    "\n",
    "When getting used to searchlights it is encouraged that you scale up your code gently. This is to prevent the possibility that you run a searchlight that takes a very long time to finish only to find there was a small error (which happens a lot). Instead it is better to write a simple function that runs quickly so you can check if your code works properly before scaling up. A simple workflow for testing your searchlight (and estimating how long your searchlight would take on a bigger dataset) would be this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a mask of one voxel and run the searchlight interactively (like we are doing now, using a notebook) to check whether the code works.\n",
    "2. Use Timestamps to extract the execution time  \n",
    "3. Print the number of voxels that are passed to the searchlight function  \n",
    "4. Run the searchlight as a job on the smallest unit of real data you have (a single run or single participant)\n",
    "5. Check the runtime and memory usage of this searchlight (e.g. on slurm: sacct -j $JID --format=jobid,maxvmsize,elapsed).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Taking our own advice, we are going to write a searchlight script below to perform a very, very simple searchlight. In fact we are only going to run this searchlight on one voxel in the brain so that we can see whether our code is working and how long each searchlight would take. After we have familiarized ourselves with the way searchlights work on a small scale, we will then graduate to full scale analyses using batch scripts and cluster computing."

The [nilearn package](http://nilearn.github.io/plotting/index.html) has multiple plotting options to allow you to view your data within python. This is good for quick visualizations but can be buggy and is not great for exploration. You can also view the data in other packages such as FSL or AFNI. For instance on Milgram, you can run `module load Apps/FSL/5.0.6; fslview sub-01_SL_result.nii.gz` to view the results. If you followed the steps above, you likely won't see many bright spots because we only ran the searchlight in a tiny part of the brain. But if you look at the data in fslview and change the coordinates to X=80, Y=54, Z=9 you should see a non-zero value."

    "Running searchlight analyses through notebooks or interactive sessions isn't tractable for real studies. Although the example above ran quickly and without parallelization, we only performed 64 analyses. Thus, we are now going to write a script to run a searchlight as a \"batch\" job. To learn how to submit jobs, you need to know a bit about [slurm](https://research.computing.yale.edu/support/hpc/user-guide/slurm), the scheduling system used on Milgram. But don't worry, you have been submitting batch jobs via slurm since the first class -- every time you use ./launch_jupyter.sh, you submit a job.\n",

    "To run a job, a good work flow is to have two scripts: One script that actually does the computation you care about (e.g., a python script like utils.py) and a bash script that sets up the environment and specifies the job parameters. The environment refers to the modules and packages you need to run your job. The job parameters refer to the partition you are going to use (-p), the number of cores (-n), the amount of memory (-m) and required time (-t). To run your job you then call the bash script with something like: 'sbatch script.sh'\n",
    "\n",

Please explore this script to get familar with submitting jobs.

    "When you parallelize an analysis across multiple cores, this typically means that each core will run the code independently (though there are ways for cores to communicate directly with each other). This means you will load in all of the data on each core. The searchlight function then notices that there are multiple cores running the same job and assigns different pieces of the data to each core for analysis. The message passing interface (MPI), the parallelizing framework used by BrainIAK and most high-performance computing applications, keeps track of each core by assigning it a rank, starting at 0. In other words, if you are running an analysis across 2 cores then some of your computations will be run with rank=0 and some with rank=1. After the searchlights have all finished, you need to save the data. MPI makes the results available on all of the cores, but we typically save the results from the rank-0 core.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Self-study:** Check that MPI is handling ranks and blocks as you expected. To do this create a searchlight that outputs the rank (doesn't do anything with the input data). To set this up you probably want to pull out the rank from the global variable MPI ('rank=MPI.COMM_WORLD.rank') on each searchlight and return the rank as an output. You should get different voxels with different rank values in the range of the number of cores you ran and this should be blocky such that each block has the side length of max_blk_edge.\n",
